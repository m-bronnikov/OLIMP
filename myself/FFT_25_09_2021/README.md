# Fast Fourier Transform Understanding

## What is it?

This is just a training of complex-number Fast Fourier Transform in order to understand algorithm.

## Structure

- */src* - source files for custom compex numbers and FFT algorithm dependent to complex numbers.
- */include* - include files with function definitions.
- *main.cpp* - simple example with how to run forward and inverse FFT.
- *Makefile* - build file which compiles and builds executable from *main.cpp*

## What next?

1. Create shared or static library from algorithm sources and link executable with this lib instead object files creation with linkage with them.
2. Add more examples (e.g. polynomus multiplication).
